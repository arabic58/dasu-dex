## Description

We will build an NFT collection based on the [ETB token](https://bscscan.com/token/0x7ac64008fa000bfdc4494e0bfcc9f4eff3d51d2a):

* Each NFT represents a software developer
* Each developer NFT has some traits related to programming
  * trait examples: Frontend skills, Backend skills...
  * Some traits are more rare than others
* Each developer NFT has an associated image, that is related to his traits
* 2 developers NFTs can merge and create a new developer NFT
  * the new developer inherits from the traits of his parents, plus some random new trait not in his parents
  * the more ETB tokens you have, the more chance there is to have new traits that are valuable
  * you can checkout how cryptokitties work, it can give some inspiration
  * another inspiration can be cryptopunk, for the image generation

Deliverables:
* Smart contract
* Images
* Frontend to visualize and merge NFTs

Recommended tech:
* Javascript 
* NextJS
* Web3 or Ethers
* Truffle or Hardhat
